> They creep in like thieves in the night, corrupting memory and leaving us in despair.
> Yet, amidst the chaos, they remind us of the fragility of our creations and the importance of vigilance.
> To those who battle these demons daily, know that your struggle is noted and celebrated.
> May your debugging tools be ever sharp, and may your patience never wane.
> Remember, every fault fixed is a step closer to a bug-free world... or at least our own small corner of it.
