> They creep in like thieves in the night, corrupting memory and leaving us in despair.
> Yet, amidst the chaos, they remind us of the fragility of our creations and the importance of vigilance.
> To those who battle these demons daily, know that your struggle is noted and celebrated.
> May your debugging tools be ever sharp, and may your patience never wane.
> Remember, every fault fixed is a step closer to a bug-free world... or at least our own small corner of it.

> [!WARNING]
> **You are not smarter than the compiler and you shouldn't be.**

> [!TIP]
> **None, null, nil and the whole "_trust yourself_" story...**
> 
> Why don't programmers ever trust themselves to choose default values?
> Because they're afraid they might pick null!
> 🤦‍♂️ Imagine if every time you forgot to set a value, your computer decided to give you a big fat null instead of a sensible default.
> It's like having a magic 8-ball that only answers with "_It's complicated_" unless you explicitly ask for "_Yes_" or "_No_". 🎱🙈
